Just install the required libraries and models from huggingface using the commands in the code. One model "mental/mental-bert-base-uncased" will not be downloaded directly to get access to this model you will need to make an account on huggingface and get a unique token to access that model. If you get lost dw i too did just surf net you'll find it

## Discussion 
This project is pretty straightforward as you can see But I wanted to introduce this chatbot self-thinking with the help of Google's Word2vec I have used it before for my ZSL project in the trial.ipynb I was testing it out. You can download it via Kaggle. I will try to improve this and make it a much better version. I recently got to know Scispacy I might try to incorporate that into this. 

until next timee
